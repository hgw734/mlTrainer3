# Data Compliance and Model Sandboxing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the data compliance enforcement actions taken to ensure all models in the mlTrainer system comply with the strict data source requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

As specified by the system requirements:

1. **Approved Data Sources Only**
   - Polygon.io - for market data
   - FRED - for economic data
   - NO other data sources are currently approved

2. **No Synthetic or Placeholder Data**
   - No random data generation
   - No mock/fake/dummy data
   - No synthetic data of any kind
   - All data MUST come from real APIs

3. **Data Lineage Tracking**
   - All data must be tagged with its source
   - Tags must be maintained indefinitely
   - Full audit trail required

## Models Sandboxed

The following 27 models have been identified as requiring alternative data sources and have been SANDBOXED (disabled):

### NLP/Sentiment Models (3)
- `finbert_sentiment_classifier` - Requires real news/social media APIs
- `bert_classification_head` - Requires labeled text data from web
- `sentence_transformer_embedding` - Requires text data pairs

### Market Microstructure Models (5)
- `market_impact_models` - Requires real order book data
- `order_flow_analysis` - Requires real order flow data
- `bid_ask_spread_analysis` - Requires real quote/trade data
- `liquidity_assessment` - Requires real market depth data
- `order_book_imbalance_model` - Requires real order book data

### Reinforcement Learning Models (5)
- `q_learning` - Often used with crypto/DeFi data
- `double_q_learning` - Often used with crypto/DeFi data
- `dueling_dqn` - Often used with crypto/DeFi data
- `dqn` - Often used with crypto/DeFi data
- `regime_aware_dqn` - Often used with market regime data

### Alternative Data Models (4)
- `alternative_data_model` - Explicitly requires satellite/alternative data
- `network_topology_analysis` - Requires graph/network data
- `vision_transformer_chart` - Requires chart images
- `graph_neural_network` - Requires graph data structures

### Advanced/Cutting-Edge Models (9)
- `adversarial_momentum_net` - Requires specialized momentum data
- `fractal_model` - Requires high-frequency fractal analysis data
- `wavelet_transform_model` - Requires signal processing data
- `empirical_mode_decomposition` - Requires decomposition data
- `neural_ode_financial` - Requires continuous time series data
- `hurst_exponent_fractal` - Requires fractal time series data
- `threshold_autoregressive` - Requires nonlinear time series data
- `model_architecture_search` - Requires diverse training data
- `lempel_ziv_complexity` - Requires binary sequence data

### Transformer Models (2)
- `transformer` - Requires tokenized sequential data
- `temporal_fusion_transformer` - Requires multi-modal time series data

### Risk Models (1)
- `market_stress_indicators` - Requires stress scenario data

## Data Sources Required But Not Available

The sandboxed models require the following types of data that are NOT available through Polygon.io or FRED:

1. **Satellite Imagery APIs**
   - Planet Labs
   - Orbital Insight
   - Other satellite data providers

2. **Web Scraping/Social Media APIs**
   - News aggregation APIs
   - Social media sentiment APIs
   - Web scraping infrastructure

3. **Supply Chain Data**
   - Shipping/port activity APIs
   - Supply chain tracking APIs

4. **Weather Data**
   - NOAA APIs
   - Weather.gov APIs
   - Climate data feeds

5. **Crypto/DeFi Data**
   - Ethereum node connections (Infura/Alchemy)
   - DeFi protocol APIs (The Graph, Dune Analytics)
   - MEV data from Flashbots API
   - Cross-chain price feeds from DEX APIs

6. **Market Microstructure Data**
   - Real-time order book data
   - Level 2 market data
   - Trade-by-trade data
   - Market depth information

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`sandbox_alternative_data_models.py`**
   - Comprehensive sandboxing system
   - Identifies models requiring alternative data
   - Enforces sandbox restrictions

2. **`analyze_alternative_data_models.py`**
   - Analyzes all models for data requirements
   - Generates detailed reports

3. **`enforce_data_compliance.py`**
   - Enforces compliance rules across the system
   - Creates sandbox marker files
   - Checks for violations

### Reports Generated

1. **`ALTERNATIVE_DATA_MODELS_ANALYSIS.md`**
   - Detailed analysis of models requiring alternative data
   - Categories affected
   - Recommendations

2. **`sandboxed_models_config.json`**
   - Machine-readable list of sandboxed models
   - Used by the system to prevent usage

3. **`sandboxed_models/`** directory
   - Contains individual `.sandbox` files for each disabled model
   - Prevents accidental usage

## Compliance Status

✅ **COMPLIANT** - All models requiring alternative data sources have been sandboxed

## Next Steps

1. **To Enable Sandboxed Models**:
   - Integrate proper data sources (must be real APIs, not synthetic)
   - Update `api_config.py` with new approved sources
   - Implement data connectors with full lineage tracking
   - Remove models from sandbox list after integration

2. **Priority Integrations**:
   - Market microstructure data (for trading models)
   - NLP/sentiment data feeds (for sentiment analysis)
   - Alternative data APIs (for advanced analytics)

3. **Compliance Maintenance**:
   - Regular audits of data sources
   - Continuous monitoring of data lineage
   - Enforcement of tagging requirements

## Important Notes

⚠️ **NO WORKAROUNDS**: Do not attempt to bypass these restrictions with synthetic data or placeholders. The compliance system will detect and prevent such attempts.

⚠️ **PRODUCTION READINESS**: Only models using Polygon.io and FRED data are production-ready. All others are disabled.

⚠️ **DATA TAGGING**: Even for approved sources, all data must be properly tagged with source information that persists indefinitely.
