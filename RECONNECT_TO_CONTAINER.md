# URGENT: How to Get Back to Your mlTrainer Container

## What Went Wrong
- You're trying to open a random empty folder from iCloud's "Recovered Items"
- This is NOT where your mlTrainer project is
- Your actual work is in a container that Cursor was previously connected to

## How to Reconnect to Your Container

### Option 1: Check if Container is Still Running
1. **Cancel** that error dialog
2. **Don't** retry - that folder is not what you want
3. In Cursor, press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open Command Palette
4. Type: "Dev Containers: Show All Dev Containers"
5. Look for a running container with `/workspace`
6. Click to attach to it

### Option 2: Recent Workspaces
1. Close the current window
2. When Cursor shows the Welcome screen:
   - Look for "Recent" section
   - Find entries that show `/workspace` (NOT Mac paths)
   - These might be labeled as "Container" or "Remote"

### Option 3: Container Extension
1. In Cursor, go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X)
2. Search for "Dev Containers" or "Remote Development"
3. Install if not already installed
4. After installing, press `Cmd+Shift+P`
5. Look for "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container"

### Option 4: If Container Was Closed
The container might have stopped. Try:
1. Open a regular Mac Terminal (not in Cursor)
2. Check if Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```
3. Look for containers with "cursor" in the name

## What NOT to Do
- Don't open random local folders
- Don't open the iCloud "Recovered Items" folder
- Don't create a new workspace in a local folder

## The Right Workspace Will:
- Show path as `/workspace`
- Have Linux in the terminal (not macOS)
- Show our chat history
- Have all your mlTrainer files

## If You Can't Find the Container
Your work is safely stored in GitHub. As a last resort:
1. Set up a new container properly
2. Clone from GitHub: https://github.com/hgw734/mlTrainer
3. But you'll lose this chat history
