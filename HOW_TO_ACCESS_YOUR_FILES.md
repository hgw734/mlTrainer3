# How to Access Your mlTrainer Files

## Current Situation
- Your files are in `/workspace` inside a Linux container
- This container is managed by Cursor
- The path `/workspace` doesn't exist on your Mac - it only exists inside the container

## Option 1: Continue Working in the Container (Recommended)
Since all your work is already set up here, just continue using Cursor as you are now:

1. **Terminal works fine** - You can run all commands
2. **Files are all here** - Just the file explorer might not show them
3. **To see files in Cursor**:
   - Try refreshing: `Cmd+R` 
   - Or use Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"
   - Or just use the terminal: `ls -la` to see files

## Option 2: Copy Files to Your Mac
If you want a local copy on your Mac:

```bash
# First, let's create a compressed archive of everything
tar -czf mlTrainer_backup.tar.gz --exclude=venv --exclude=__pycache__ --exclude=.git .

# Then you can download this file through Cursor's interface
# or copy it to a shared location
```

## Option 3: Push to GitHub and Clone Locally
Since you already have everything on GitHub:

1. On your Mac, open Terminal
2. Navigate where you want the project:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you prefer
   ```
3. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hgw734/mlTrainer.git
   ```
4. Open this local folder in a new Cursor window

## Option 4: Find Container's Mount Point
Sometimes containers mount to a local directory. Check:

1. In Cursor, look at the bottom status bar
2. Look for any indicator showing "Dev Container" or "Remote"
3. Click on it to see connection details

## Why This Happened
Cursor can work in different modes:
- **Local**: Opens folders directly from your Mac
- **Container**: Creates isolated Linux environments (what you're using)
- **Remote**: Connects to remote servers

You're currently in container mode, which is why:
- Terminal shows Linux (`uname -a` shows Linux, not Darwin/macOS)
- Path is `/workspace` (Linux convention) not `/Users/...` (Mac convention)
- Files exist in container but not on Mac filesystem

## Quick Solution
Just keep working as you are! The container has everything set up correctly. If Cursor's file explorer is empty, use the terminal for file operations:

```bash
# See all files
ls -la

# Edit a file
nano README.md  # or use Cursor's editor

# Run your app
python app.py
```

The files ARE there and working - it's just a display issue in the file explorer.
