Here's the complete workflow between me mlTrainer, and the machine learning system:

🔄 Complete Workflow Architecture
Phase 1: User Interaction
ME → Streamlit Interface (interactive_app.py)
↓
Input: "Analyze AAPL with LSTM model"
↓
mlTrainer Engine receives request mlTrainer makes a suggestion on how to proceed. Once I ok the suggestion: 
Phase 2: mlTrainer Agent Processing
mlTrainer Engine (core/mlTrainer_engine.py)
↓
Detects ML trigger keywords OR stock symbols
↓
Routes to: start_trial() with trial_config
↓
mlTrainer Client Wrapper (core/mlTrainer_client_wrapper.py)
↓
Sends to Claude API with system prompt:
"You are mlTrainer, the PRIMARY AUTONOMOUS AGENT" 
Phase 3: Real-Time ML Communication
ML Engine (ml/ml_trainer.py) ←→ mlTrainer Agent
↓
Communication Flow:
1. Volatility Check → mlTrainer decides train_ratio
2. Training Progress → mlTrainer approves/modifies model
3. Initial Results → mlTrainer decides: continue/retrain/switch_model/optimize
↓
Actions Available:
- continue: Proceed with current model
- retrain: Adjust parameters and retrain
- switch_model: Change to XGBoost/LSTM/Transformer/Ensemble
- optimize: Run hyperparameter optimization 
Phase 4: ML System Execution
ML System processes decision:
↓
Model Training Pipeline:
1. Data Loading (polygon_interface.py)
2. Model Selection (model_registry.py)
3. Training with real-time feedback
4. Metrics Calculation
5. Paper Trading Simulation
↓
Returns structured result to mlTrainer  This process repeats in as real time as feasible until trial or paper trading is complete. Then: 
Phase 5: Response Generation
mlTrainer Agent receives ML results
↓
Generates commentary via Claude
↓
Final response combines:
- Direct answer to your query
- ML analysis results
- Trading insights
- Recommendations
↓
I receive comprehensive response in Streamlit
📞 Communication Protocol Example
When you ask: "Run trial on TSLA" mlTrainer makes suggestions. I communicate with it until I am satisfied with the suggestion. Then: 
1. mlTrainer detects symbol → auto-configures trial
2. ML Engine asks: "High volatility detected (8.2%). Adjust train_ratio?"
3. mlTrainer responds: "ACTION: retrain, REASON: High volatility requires conservative split"
4. ML Engine retrains with new parameters
5. ML Engine asks: "Initial accuracy: 73%. Continue or switch model?"
6. mlTrainer decides: "ACTION: switch_model, NEW_MODEL: XGBoost"
7. ML Engine switches to XGBoost and completes training
8. mlTrainer provides final analysis to you
🎯 Key Components
* You: Provide prompts via Streamlit interface
* mlTrainer Agent: Claude-powered decision maker with ML system control
* ML System: Executes training with real-time agent communication
* Communication Callback: Enables live agent-to-agent discussions during training
This creates a true AI-to-AI collaboration where mlTrainer actively manages the ML process rather than just processing results.
