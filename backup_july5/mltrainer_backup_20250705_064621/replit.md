# mlTrainer - Trading Intelligence System

## Overview

mlTrainer is a sophisticated AI-powered trading intelligence system that combines comprehensive machine learning capabilities, multi-model analytical frameworks, and systematic trading intelligence. The system features a diverse ML toolkit including technical analysis, quantitative methods, behavioral finance, and market intelligence tools designed for optimal trading strategies.

The application follows a hybrid architecture with a Streamlit frontend for user interaction and a Flask backend API for data processing and ML operations. All data must be verified from authorized sources (Polygon, FRED, QuiverQuant), and any unverified responses trigger "I don't know" responses with data-backed suggestions.
