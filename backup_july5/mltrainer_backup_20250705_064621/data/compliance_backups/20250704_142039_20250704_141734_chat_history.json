But based on the system architecture, I would suggest we need to:\n\n1. Establish verified data connections first\n2. Initialize the regime detection models\n3. Set up the walk-forward testing parameters (lookback period, rebalancing frequency)\n4. Define performance metrics for evaluation\n\nWould you like me to outline the specific walk-forward testing framework we should implement once our data connections are verified? This would include the backtesting methodology, model validation steps, and performance benchmarks we'll use to ensure system reliability.\n\nWhat's your preferred timeframe and asset universe for this initial trial?",
