- **Financial Models**: Black-Scholes, portfolio optimization, VaR
- **Compliance Gateway**: Immutable rules, data source verification
- **Goal System**: Context-aware execution
- **Real APIs**: Polygon (market data), FRED (economic data)

### New in Unified
- **Unified Executor**: Single interface for all models
- **Compliance-Aware Trials**: Every step verified
- **Topic-Based Search**: Find relevant history quickly
- **Integrated Goal Display**: Always visible in UI
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Full execution history

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Unified Executor
```python
# Automatically registers all 140+ models as actions
executor = get_unified_executor()

# Parse natural language for executable actions
parsed = executor.parse_mltrainer_response(response)

# Execute with compliance checks
result = executor.execute_ml_model_training(
    "random_forest_100", 
    symbol="AAPL",
    data_source="polygon"  # Verified against whitelist
)
```

### Enhanced Background Manager
```python
# Create trial from mlTrainer response
manager = get_enhanced_background_manager()
trial_id = manager.start_trial(mltrainer_response)

# Compliance checked at each step
manager.execute_trial_step(trial_id, action, params)

# Real-time progress tracking
status = manager.get_trial_status(trial_id)
```

### Unified Memory System
```python
# Stores with importance scoring and topics
memory = get_unified_memory()
memory.add_message(role, content, goal_context=goal)

# Search by topic
results = memory.search_by_topic("portfolio optimization")

# Track compliance events
memory.add_compliance_event("data_source_blocked", details)
```

## 📊 Available Models

### ML Models (140+)
- **Linear**: Logistic Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
- **Tree-Based**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Neural Networks**: MLP, Deep Networks (50/100 layers)
- **SVM**: Linear, RBF, Polynomial kernels
- **Clustering**: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative
- **Ensemble**: Voting, Stacking, AdaBoost, Bagging

### Financial Models
- **Options**: Black-Scholes pricing, Greeks calculation
- **Portfolio**: Mean-variance, risk parity optimization
- **Technical**: MA crossover, RSI, Bollinger Bands
- **Risk**: VaR, CVaR, stress testing
- **Simulation**: Monte Carlo for option pricing

## 🛡️ Compliance Features

### Immutable Rules
```python
NO_SYNTHETIC_DATA = True
NO_DATA_GENERATORS = True
APPROVED_DATA_SOURCES = ['polygon', 'fred', 'user_provided']
```

### Goal-Aware Execution
- Goals influence model selection
- Compliance requirements from goal text
- Anti-drift protection ensures consistency

### Audit Trail
- Every execution logged with timestamp
- Compliance checks recorded
- Full parameter history
- Searchable by topic

## 🚀 Deployment

### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements_unified.txt
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key  
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
```

### Launch
```bash
streamlit run mltrainer_unified_chat.py
```

### Access
- Desktop: http://localhost:8501
- Mobile: Same URL (responsive design)

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The UI automatically adapts:
- Full-width buttons on mobile
- Collapsible sidebar
- Touch-optimized controls

2. **mlTrainer**: "I'll run a comprehensive analysis..."

3. **System**:
   - Parses response for executable actions
   - Creates background trial
   - Checks compliance (data sources, models)
   - Executes models in sequence
   - Stores results with topics

4. **Result**: Actionable insights with full audit trail

## 🎯 Production Readiness

### Scalability
- Async execution for long-running tasks
- Background trial queue management
- Efficient memory indexing
- API rate limiting with circuit breaker

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Persistent state across restarts
