"TITLE: Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Prediction
"
"Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of LSTM and Transformer models
"for stock price prediction in momentum trading strategies.
"
"1. Introduction
"Financial markets present unique challenges for machine learning due to their
"non - stationary nature and high noise - to - signal ratio.
"
"2. Methodology
"We employed a dual - model approach:     " - LSTM with attention mechanisms for short - term predictions(7 - 12 days)
    "- Transformer architecture for medium - term predictions(50 - 70 days)
    "
    "The models were trained on 5 years of historical data with a train ratio of 0.8.
    "Learning rate was set to 0.001 with adaptive scheduling.
    "
    "3. Results
    "Our experiments yielded the following results:         " - LSTM accuracy: 73.5 % for 7 - 12 day predictions
        "- Transformer accuracy: 68.2 % for 50 - 70 day predictions
        "- Combined model Sharpe ratio: 1.92
        "- Annual returns: 18.7 % with maximum drawdown of 12.3 %         "
        "4. Conclusion
        "The hybrid LSTM - Transformer approach significantly outperformed baseline models.
        "The LSTM excelled at capturing short - term momentum patterns while the Transformer
        "better understood longer - term market regimes. Future work should explore
        "reinforcement learning approaches.
