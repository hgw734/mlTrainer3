TITLE: Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Prediction

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of LSTM and Transformer models
for stock price prediction in momentum trading strategies.

1. Introduction
Financial markets present unique challenges for machine learning due to their
non-stationary nature and high noise-to-signal ratio.

2. Methodology
We employed a dual-model approach:
- LSTM with attention mechanisms for short-term predictions (7-12 days)
- Transformer architecture for medium-term predictions (50-70 days)

The models were trained on 5 years of historical data with a train ratio of 0.8.
Learning rate was set to 0.001 with adaptive scheduling.

3. Results
Our experiments yielded the following results:
- LSTM accuracy: 73.5% for 7-12 day predictions
- Transformer accuracy: 68.2% for 50-70 day predictions
- Combined model Sharpe ratio: 1.92
- Annual returns: 18.7% with maximum drawdown of 12.3%

4. Conclusion
The hybrid LSTM-Transformer approach significantly outperformed baseline models.
The LSTM excelled at capturing short-term momentum patterns while the Transformer
better understood longer-term market regimes. Future work should explore
reinforcement learning approaches.
