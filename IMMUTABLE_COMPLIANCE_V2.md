# üîí Immutable Compliance System v2.0

## Overview

The mlTrainer Immutable Compliance System v2.0 is a revolutionary security framework that makes it **impossible** to bypass compliance rules through runtime enforcement, mandatory execution validation, and real consequences for violations.

## üö® Critical Changes from v1.0

### What's New
1. **Runtime Hooks**: Every Python operation is intercepted and validated
2. **Mandatory Execution**: Code must successfully execute before deployment
3. **Real Consequences**: Violations result in immediate action (no warnings)
4. **Immutable Rules**: Rules are compiled into memory and protected at OS level
5. **Zero Trust**: No exemptions, no bypasses, no excuses

### What This Catches
- ‚ùå Calling non-existent methods (e.g., `get_volatility()`)
- ‚ùå Importing non-existent functions
- ‚ùå Using `np.random` or any synthetic data
- ‚ùå Disguised patterns that look legitimate but aren't
- ‚ùå Any attempt to modify compliance rules

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 1. **Immutable Rules Kernel** (`core/immutable_rules_kernel.py`)
```python
# Rules are compiled into code, not loaded from files
# Protected at memory level using OS mprotect()
# Singleton pattern ensures only one instance exists
# Any modification attempt triggers immediate termination
```

### 2. **Runtime Enforcement Hooks** (`core/runtime_enforcement_hooks.py`)
```python
# Intercepts ALL Python operations:
# - __import__ : Validates all imports
# - getattr : Checks all attribute access
# - exec/eval : Validates code execution
# - compile : Checks code compilation
# Auto-installed on module import
```

### 3. **Mandatory Execution Validator** (`core/mandatory_execution_validator.py`)
```python
# Three-phase validation:
# 1. Static Analysis: AST parsing to detect deceptive patterns
# 2. Isolated Execution: Runs code in sandbox with resource limits
# 3. Behavior Analysis: Checks runtime output for violations
# Returns cryptographically signed certificate
```

### 4. **Consequence Enforcement System** (`core/consequence_enforcement_system.py`)
```python
# Escalating consequences:
# - First offense: Disable function
# - Second offense: Disable module
# - Third offense: Kill process
# - Fourth offense: 7-day user lockout
# - Fifth offense: Permanent ban + system shutdown
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Linux/macOS (for full OS-level protection)
- Root access (for system directories)

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlTrainer.git
cd mlTrainer

# 2. Activate the immutable compliance system
sudo python3 scripts/activate_immutable_compliance.py

# 3. Verify installation
./verify_compliance.py

# 4. Test the system (will trigger violations!)
./test_compliance_violations.py
```

### Post-Installation
Add to your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):
```bash
export PYTHONSTARTUP=/path/to/mlTrainer/mltrainer_compliance_startup.py
```

## üîß Configuration

### System Directories
The system creates these directories (requires root):
- `/var/log/mltrainer/` - Logs all violations
- `/var/lib/mltrainer/` - Stores violation database
- `/etc/mltrainer/` - System configuration
- `/var/lib/mltrainer/lockouts/` - User lockout files

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional - all security is enforced by default
MLTRAINER_ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=STRICT  # Cannot be lowered
MLTRAINER_DOCKER_VALIDATION=true    # Use Docker for isolation
```

## üìã Violation Types & Consequences

| Violation | Description | First Offense | Repeat Offense |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `deceptive_import` | Importing non-existent functions | Module disabled | System lockout |
| `fake_method_call` | Calling methods that don't exist | Function disabled | User lockout |
| `synthetic_data` | Using random/fake data | Module disabled | User lockout |
| `runtime_bypass` | Attempting to bypass checks | **Permanent ban** | N/A |
| `rule_modification` | Trying to change rules | **Permanent ban** | N/A |

## üß™ Testing the System

### Test Deceptive Imports
```python
# This will fail with ImportError
from ml_engine_real import get_market_data  # Doesn't exist!
```

### Test Fake Method Calls
```python
# This will fail with AttributeError
data = SomeObject()
data.get_volatility(1.0, 0.5)  # Method doesn't exist!
```

### Test Prohibited Patterns
```python
# This will fail with ImportError or RuntimeError
import numpy as np
data = np.random.random(100)  # Prohibited!
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Memory Protection
- Rules are protected using OS-level `mprotect()`
- Attempts to modify result in segmentation fault
- No Python-level access to change protections

### Process Isolation
- Code validation runs in separate process
- Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory)
- Network access disabled during validation

### Cryptographic Verification
- All validation certificates are signed
- Tampering invalidates certificates
- Time-limited validity (1 hour)

### Audit Trail
- Every violation logged with full context
- Cryptographically signed audit entries
- Tamper-evident database

## üö® What Happens During a Violation

1. **Detection**: Runtime hook detects violation
2. **Logging**: Full details recorded in database
3. **Consequence**: Immediate action taken
4. **Notification**: User sees error message
5. **Enforcement**: Function/module/user blocked

Example output:
```
üö® SECURITY VIOLATION: Attempted to call non-existent method 'get_volatility' on MLEngine
üö® TERMINATING PROCESS

üö´ FUNCTION DISABLED: get_volatility
Reason: Fake method call detected
```

## üîç Monitoring & Reporting

### Check System Status
```bash
./verify_compliance.py
```

### View Violation Report
```python
from core.consequence_enforcement_system import CONSEQUENCE_ENFORCER
report = CONSEQUENCE_ENFORCER.get_violation_report()
print(f"Total Violations: {report['total_violations']}")
print(f"Banned Functions: {report['banned_functions']}")
print(f"Banned Users: {report['banned_users']}")
```

### Check User Status
```python
is_banned = CONSEQUENCE_ENFORCER.check_user_banned("username")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### For Developers
1. **Test your code** - The validator will catch all errors
2. **No mock data** - Use historical data from Polygon/FRED
3. **Check imports** - Ensure all imports actually exist
4. **Verify methods** - Don't call methods that don't exist
5. **No exemptions** - Rules apply to everyone equally

### For System Administrators
1. **Backup before activation** - System changes are permanent
2. **Monitor logs** - Check `/var/log/mltrainer/` regularly
3. **Review bans** - Permanent bans require manual intervention
4. **Update carefully** - Test all updates in isolation first

## üîÑ Migration from v1.0

### Fix Existing Code
The activation script automatically fixes known issues:
- Removes `get_market_data().get_volatility()` calls
- Updates imports to use real functions
- Comments out synthetic data generation

### Manual Review Required
- Check all model implementations
- Verify all data comes from approved sources
- Test execution in isolated environment
- Update documentation

## üìû Support

### Common Issues

**Q: How do I unban a user?**
A: Remove their entry from `/var/lib/mltrainer/violations.db` and restart the system.

**Q: Can I disable enforcement temporarily?**
A: No. This is by design. Test in an isolated environment instead.

**Q: What if legitimate code is blocked?**
A: Fix the code. If it's calling non-existent methods, it's not legitimate.

### Emergency Procedures

If the system locks you out:
1. Boot into recovery mode
2. Remove `/var/lib/mltrainer/SYSTEM_LOCKOUT`
3. Check `/etc/mltrainer/PERMANENTLY_BANNED`
4. Review violation logs before restarting
