# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture for mlTrainer

**Date**: 2024-07-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Engineering Team  

## Context

We need to design a scalable ML platform that can:
- Handle 140+ different ML models
- Process real-time market data
- Scale horizontally for high load
- Maintain high availability during market hours
- Support both batch and real-time predictions

## Decision

We will adopt a **microservices architecture** with the following components:

1. **API Gateway** - Single entry point for all requests
2. **ML Engine Service** - Core prediction and training logic
3. **Market Data Service** - Real-time and historical data
4. **Model Registry** - Model versioning and management
5. **Cache Layer** - Redis for performance
6. **Message Queue** - Async job processing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation between services
- **Technology flexibility**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Team autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Performance**: Specialized optimization per service

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Network latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data consistency**: Distributed transaction challenges
- **Operational overhead**: More services to monitor

### Mitigation
- Use service mesh (Istio) for communication
- Implement circuit breakers and retry logic
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Strong API contracts between services

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Scaling limitations, technology lock-in
- **Rejected because**: Won't scale to our performance needs

### 2. Serverless Functions
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Cold starts, vendor lock-in
- **Rejected because**: Need more control over ML model lifecycle

## Implementation Notes

```python
# Service boundaries
services = {
    "api_gateway": {
        "tech": "FastAPI + Kong",
        "responsibilities": ["routing", "auth", "rate_limiting"]
    },
    "ml_engine": {
        "tech": "Python + PyTorch/TensorFlow",
        "responsibilities": ["predictions", "training", "model_serving"]
    },
    "market_data": {
        "tech": "Go + WebSockets",
        "responsibilities": ["real_time_feed", "historical_data"]
    }
}
```
